<p> THE BAND STARTED EARLY SEPTEMBER OF 2005 ON THE STREETS OF STA, ROSA, LAGUNA PHILIPPINES. WE ALL GREW UP IN THE SAME PLACE WITH ALMOST THE SAME INTEREST IN MUSIC, LIFESTYLE AND BELIEFS. THOUGH WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STRUGGLES BOUND TO CAPTURE ALL OUR EXPERIENCES, CHOICES INTO ONE WHICH CAUSES US TO FORM A BAND. OUR MUSIC DEFIES A EAR BLASTING AND GROOVY BEATS, SCRATCHY GUITAR RIFFS AND TREMBLING BASS LINES. WE PLAY MUSIC FOR OURSELVES AND FOR THOSE WHO APPRECIATE IT. WE STARTED AS COVER BAND UNTIL FROM TIME TO TIME WE CREATE OUR OWN ORIGINALS. BASED ON OUR STRUGGLES AND OBSTACLES IN LIFE. AS WE GROW TOGETHER ALONG THE STREETS OF LAGUNA WITH OUR BROTHER BANDS ESPECIALLY PILEDRIVER, IT TEACHES US TO STAND OUR GROUND AND DEFEND OUR PASSION AS WE ARE ON THE UNDERGROUND SCENE. WE MOSTLY LISTEN AND INLUENCLY BY THEM AND SUCH BAND AS CALIBAN, CONVERGE, HATEBREED, ONE LIFE CREW, TERROR, LARIAT AND YET WE STILL EXPLORING SUCH NEW BANDS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARED THE STAGE WITH THEM SOMEDAY. AS WE LAND TO SHARE OUR MUSIC AROUND THE METRO AND SOME PART OF THE PROVINCES HERE IN THE PHILIPPINE WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT WE MEET NEW FRIENDS AND BE A PART OF OUR FAMILY. IN ALL OF US, ONE THING IS THE MOST COMMON AS WE ALL SAY "WE RATHER CALLED DRUNKARDS, THAN BASTARDS!".</p>
<p>Life is a peach!</p>

<blockquote> The term has come to mean that which is particularly good, sweet, fair and excellent. Just like the fruit itself. "Life is better than death, I believe, if only because it is less boring and it has fresh peaches in it" wrote Thomas Walker. High praise for a simple fruit. Yet such usage has grown common over time</blockquote>
